/*Create two classes called Truck and Engine without default constructors, 
but with constructors that take an argument of type string, which they simply copy to an internal string variable. 
For each class, write the correct copy-constructor.
Now derive a class HeavyTruck from Truck and give it a member object of type Engine. 
Write the correct default constructor, 
a constructor that takes a string argument, a copy-constructor.*/
